# Drift_Final
This is the final version of Drift app for Mobile App Design

Drift is the name of an iOS iPad-centric web app from my year long Mobile App Design Class during my senior year.

I was on a team of three (Angela Zarek, Jessica Esquivel, and myself) to help design and develop an app for UIC Ear, Nose, and Throat Clinic. After a few weeks of interviews and market reaserch, my team discovered that a lot of the problems was because the front-desk was busy with paperwork, and there was miscommunication between the assistants and the front desk clerks. Our was Drift.

Drift is a patient registration app that lets users (patients) enter their data digitally instead of using paper, allowing users upload images of their insurance card, review and submit their information to the front desk, and learn more about the clinic and staff.

Angela was in charge of the front-end design/development and Xcode app deployment. Jessica was in charge of the client presentation and market research. I was in charge of designing the backgrounds and icons, as well of programming the back-end and assiting Angela and Jessica with the front-end.
